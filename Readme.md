1. User can browse and select an XML file from their system
2. The program parses the data from the XML and translates the results into an Excel file

Future improvements:

1. It should be able to parse any XML file provided to it
2. It should be able to run as an executable file
3. Error handling
4. User should be able to see a "Browse" button instead of "Open," which is default
